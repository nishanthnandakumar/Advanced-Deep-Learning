# Advanced-Deep-Learning
This repository includes the project to be completed as part of the course Advanced Deep Learning at Ravensburg-Weingarten University of Applied Sciences.

This project is based on the work in the paper ['ECG Heartbeat Classification: A Deep Transferable Representation'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00794). The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset are used to train and validate the model. The MIT-BIH dataset has 5 different classes as shown in the figure ![](mit.png) and the PTB Diagnostic dataset has two classes as shown in the figure ![](ptb.png)


MLP baseline model and ResNet models are used in this project and evaluate their performance on the datasets.

The detailed explaination has been provided as part of colab notebook.
