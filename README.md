# Advanced-Deep-Learning
This repository includes the assignment which were to be completed as part of the course Advanced Deep Learning at Ravensburg-Weingarten University of Applied Sciences

This project is based on the work in the paper 'ECG Heartbeat Classification: A Deep Transferable Representation'. The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset are used to train and validate the model. MLP baseline model and ResNet models are used in this project and evaluate their performance on the datasets.

The detailed explaination has been provided as part of colab notebook.
